### Chrome extension for motivation

Ever get distracted from work when you're online? If you answered yes, then this extension is for you. If you answered no, you're a dirty liar.

With a simple click of a button, you can have Shia Labeouf yelling at you to "Do it" and give you the motivation to continue working on whatever you should be doing instead of watching that cat video on youtube.

To install:
* download the files into a folder
* go to chrome://extensions in your browser
* enable Developer Mode by clicking the checkbox
* click "Load unpacked extension"
* find the folder you downloaded in the step above and click "ok"

If you're ever feeling lazy and getting off track, just click the button for a friendly reminder.
